            <p><img src="images/brandon2(1x1).jpg" class="align_right medium circle"/>Hello! My name is Brandon, and I enjoy solving complex problems with innovative
                technology solutions. My journey started in college as a <span class="orange">Systems Engineering</span> major
                creating financial algorithms in data science courses and has expanded into learning
                to create web applications. </p>
            <p>Today, I am a software enginer at <span class="orange">Accenture Federal Services</span> (AFS). I function as the 
                <span class="orange">Delivery & Architecture Lead</span> for one of our <span class="orange">ServiceNow</span> programs architeting, designing, and proposing
                solutions for our clients needs. However, my interest, learning path, and skillset is much 
                broader than implementing ServiceNow solutions. Below are some technologies that I am currently working with. Keep reading to learn more about projects
                that I have created or implemented within and outside ServiceNow! </p>
